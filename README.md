# Struqt gRPC Protocol Files

This repository contains the original interface definitions of APIs that support
both REST and gRPC protocols.

Reading the original interface definitions can provide a better understanding of APIs
and help you to utilize them more efficiently.

You can also use these definitions with open source tools to generate client libraries,
documentation, and other artifacts.
